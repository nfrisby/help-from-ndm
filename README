$ ghc -fforce-recomp -O --make Test -main-is Test.main

should build ./Test



$ Ns=`ghc -e [20..25]` ACTION=validate ./Test

should print "True"



$ Ns=`ghc -e [20..25]` ACTION=bench ./Test

should generate a file summary.csv, which I'm hoping resembles the included
file expected-summary.csv.

Note that in expected-summary.csv, SYB outperforms Uni.


I suspect this is due to the "$fTraversableStr_$cmapM $fMonadKureM" being
present in the Core for the Uni.hs when compiled with -O.
